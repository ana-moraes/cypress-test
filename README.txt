What is the application:
The application provides an overview per puchase order/store/item quantity.
In this application the manager can have a clear notion about the total quantity of items in a store per purchase order

What is the required automation testing:
1. Access page with credentials attached. Credentials should not be hard-coded
2. Save values in chart in memory
3. Access table and change the quantity of order 10 to 20. Verify table data is updated and chart is updated
4. Access table and change the location of order 10 to Deli. Verify table data is updated and chart is updated.
5. Save your automation test to github and share your public git repo url

Good Luck :)
